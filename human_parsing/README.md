# FlipkartGrid (Team Ignitors - Fashion Intelligence)
This Repo focusses on a Deep Learning model which is responsible for Performing Clothes segmentation from a Human Body.

These apparels after segmentation can be passed to the [Classifier](https://github.com/Debanitrkl/FlipkartGrid/tree/master/Cloth_Classifier) which will separate the apparels into different categories, and they can then be displayed under different sections to the designers.

Adequate number of Results can be seen in [this folder](https://github.com/Debanitrkl/FlipkartGrid/tree/master/human_parsing/Results)

Example:-

![Normal Image](https://github.com/Debanitrkl/FlipkartGrid/blob/master/human_parsing/Results/4/Capture.PNG) ![Parsed Image](https://github.com/Debanitrkl/FlipkartGrid/blob/master/human_parsing/Results/4/example_person_vis.png)

It is Clearly Evident From here that the Parsing Model works properly and is able to Segment out various dresses.
